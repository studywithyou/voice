  mechanisms to get filenames to iterate through the files in a folder:
      basename  - returns the main filename of a file -- see manual
      fnmatch  -- matches a filename against a pattern -- see manual
      scandir -- loads the contents of a dir into an array ! ! -- see manual

      Easy way to get rid of the dots that scandir() picks up in Linux environments:

      <?php
      $directory = '/path/to/my/directory';
      $scanned_directory = array_diff(scandir($directory), array('..', '.'));
      ?>
